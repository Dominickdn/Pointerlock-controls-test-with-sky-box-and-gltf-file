# Pointerlock-controls-test-with-sky-box-and-gltf-file
Threejs project. This was done to learn how to create a sky box as well as import and resize GLTF files. I also learnt how to use shadows as well as use PBR textures.

The majority of the code seen on the pointerlock controls was taken directly from the threejs example on threejs.org.
